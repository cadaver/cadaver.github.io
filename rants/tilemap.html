Tile map data compression by Cadaver
------------------------------------

0. Introduction

Usually compressing level data in C64 games is a simple concept: just run your
data through your favorite compressor, for example Exomizer, then decompress
during runtime.

Of Covert Bitops games, Steel Ranger and the upcoming MW ULTRA need to do things
in a little more complicated manner due to utilizing small 2x2 char tiles, and
structuring their levels to multiple smaller areas / rooms (similar to Metroid
games.) The uncompressed map data can be large: Steel Ranger's 730 screens make
for 135KB bytes of tilemap data, which would almost fill the diskside by itself.

Handling large tilemaps then has three potentially conflicting requirements:

- Small size on disk
- Small size in memory when loaded, so that there is room for other resources
- Area transitions should be as fast as possible


1. The approaches

Typically, best compression ratio for disk storage is achieved by just
compressing each level's tilemap data in one go with Exomizer. But then the
question becomes, what to do with the tilemap data once the level has been
loaded?

If it's also uncompressed in one go, the amount of runtime memory required can
be unmanageably large. For example the main "city" level in Steel Ranger would 
be almost 12KB uncompressed. This would take a heavy chunk out of the dynamic 
allocation area, which also needs to be shared by sprites and loadable code.

Therefore it seems necessary to be able to uncompress only the currently entered
area into a separate "scrolling buffer", while the rest remain compressed. The 
obvious solution is to invoke Exomizer for each area separately (and this data
is loaded from the disk as-is), however doing this can not take advantage of 
compression of similar byte sequences across areas, and also adds overhead of
the Exomizer encoding header, unless all the areas of a level are compressed 
with the same encoding parameters, so that the header can only be stored once.

To address these issues, both Steel Ranger and MW ULTRA devise an intermediate
compressed tilemap format for storing in memory. On disk, this format is further
compressed by Exomizer per level, taking advantage of cross-area compression and
requiring only one Exomizer header.

The intermediate format is decompressed to uncompressed tilemap data when
entering each area. Because this involves no bitstream manipulation, just bytes 
stored one after another, the decompression routine runs faster than Exomizer.

The intermediate format needs to be reasonably efficient for in-memory storage,
but it should also compress well further.


2. Steel Ranger data format

The "cave" levels of Steel Ranger contain a large, repeating background pattern
consisting of several tiles. Storing it as part of the tilemap would make the
compressor's job much harder and increase the diskspace requirement, so it's
replaced by the world editor with empty tiles, and recreated in code instead.

After this modification, the data is just a straightforward run-length-encoding
compression, where byte values $00-$fe are the literal tile numbers and $ff is
an escape code that indicates a RLE sequence:

$ff,length,tile

End of data is marked with a zero-length RLE run:

$ff,$00

The tile $ff is not used in the map data itself.

The RLE format does not yield very good compression, for example the city level
data goes from about 12KB to a little below 8KB. However, it was good enough
for shipping Steel Ranger, as the most important hurdle was lack of diskspace,
and Exomizer would be able to compress the RLE data well. The same level is only
a little over 3KB on disk.

See the RLE decompression implementation <a href="https://github.com/cadaver/steelranger-demo/blob/master/level.s#L353" target="_top">here</a>.


3. MW ULTRA data format

For MW ULTRA, multiple approaches were tested before arriving with the final.
Its map data is somewhat different to Steel Ranger; being a game set mostly in
urban environments, there are no repeating "cave wall" textures, but instead
there can be repeating sequences across areas (building windows, the pavement)
so these should compress well without needing to be repeated.

The initial approach was to just compress each area with Exomizer, and
decompress from memory when entering. This keeps the engine code simple, and
runtime memory use is good, but size on disk is larger than it needs to be.

Furthermore, the scrolling / screen redraw routine requires the tilemap data
interleaved at 2-byte intervals, as indexing of the map data and the screen need
to match for code efficiency reasons. A row of tile $01 followed with a row of
tile $02 below would therefore be stored as $01,$02,$01,$02,$01,$02... This 
makes the compressor's life harder.

It's however easy to store the data on disk uninterleaved, and interleave after
decompression. This gave somewhat better results.

But more approaches needed to be explored, including collecting level data to
4KB chunks, and compressing each of them separately with Exomizer. These 4KB
chunks could be decompressed into the 4KB sprite cache under the IO area (as 
sprites can always be recreated from packed data.) This yielded good 
compression, but complicated the engine code and slowed down area transitions.

Finally MW ULTRA got its own, different compressed tilemap format.

It no longer uses the tile number $ff as an escape code for sequences, but
instead sorts tiles based on usage, so that part of the byte range can be
used for dictionary sequences and RLE sequences. The encoding becomes:

$00-$cf        Literal tiles $00-$cf
$d0            End of data
$d1,tile       Escape code followed by literal tile $d0-$ff (infrequent)
$d2-$e7,offset Dictionary sequence length 3-24, offset max. 256 bytes backward
$e2-$ff,tile   RLE sequence length 3-24, followed by tile to repeat

The decompression code can be seen <a href="https://github.com/cadaver/c64gameframework/blob/master/level.s#L361" target="_top">here</a>.

It handles interleaving directly during the decompression, however accessing
the interleaved data as source for dictionary sequences would be difficult, so
it also stores the last 256 bytes of output in a ring buffer in screen memory.
Because the screen is blanked during area transition, no visible trash can be
seen.

The corresponding compression code is included in the <a href="https://github.com/cadaver/c64gameframework/blob/master/tools/worlded3.cpp#L5115" target="_top">world editor</a>.

The story doesn't quite end here: after making the map data itself as small
as it could be, the next step was to shuffle the tile numbers so that the
tile definitions would compress as good as possible too. The tile numbers are
never referred to in e.g. game code, so it doesn't matter what they are.

The tile definitions are stored in 4 256-byte arrays: one for top left chars, 
followed by top right, bottom left, and bottom right. By assigning sorting keys 
to the tiles based on the chars they use, similar tiles are grouped together and 
the definitions compress better.
