Among other work (mastering also to EasyFlash cartridge format, plus the option for using a second firebutton to jump, both requested on Lemon64),
creating the soundtrack for MW ULTRA is now underway, with 6 songs complete so far.<br><br>

The soundtrack is shaping up to be a little more atmospheric and less drum-heavy compared to Hessian & Steel Ranger, and could even be considered as a complementary
method of storytelling. MW ULTRA will not have a silent protagonist like the two previous games, but yet we can count on Ian not speaking that much,
and certainly not actually thinking aloud, so the soundtrack aims to provide additional insight into his headspace.<br><br>

The basic workflow for composing is still the same as before: songs are initially composed in GoatTracker 2, taking into account
the player limitations, then converted. The conversion is now easier, as the "miniplayer" converter program produces the output directly in source code format ready for the
build process, instead of having to manually run NinjaTracker 2 and use its packer / relocator function to save the final song data.<br><br>

For testing on real C64 hardware, and to also check how the sound effects play on top of each song, the game's build process also creates a sound test program,
in which the tunes & sounds can be triggered with keys. When music is playing, sounds are played on the 1st channel only, that is typically reserved for the lowest
volume instruments, such as arpeggios or secondary melodies.<br><br>

The "miniplayer" uses a one-frame pseudo hardrestart somewhat similar to DMC4. One frame before the next note's start, the gatebit is switched off and ADSR release is set
to maximum (15.) Combined with a silent first frame (typically testbit + gate), this ensures even note starts, but doesn't give time for the sound to automatically
start from zero volume, like a proper two-frame hardrestart would do. Therefore some care is needed in composing, to set the notes to manually release early enough.
Fortunately GoatTracker 2 can be made to mimic this kind of operation with the hardrestart ADSR parameter, and setting "gateoff timer" to 1 in all instruments.<br><br>

Because notes don't always start strictly from zero volume, they blend to each other more naturally, giving the music a more organic feel. All previous Metal Warrior games that
used the earlier music playback routines had 1-frame hardrestart as well, so it's also keeping the tradition :)<br><br>

Again, using the SID filter presents a challenge. Each 6581 SID has its unique cutoff frequency curve, and filtering a voice
also lowers its volume a little. Emulation usually doesn't account for this, so there's a risk of making some sounds too loud for emulation users, or too silent for
real hardware. Yet using the filter is an essential part of C64 music, so this time either, leaving it out would not be a real option.<br><br>

Like in Steel Ranger, the game detects the SID model (6581 or 8580) on startup, and will adjust the filter cutoff for 8580 to mimic a typical 6581 (keeping tradition,
the songs are composed for 6581.) This time the cutoff adjustment is no longer just a constant subtraction, but is strongest in the middle of the cutoff range,
using a linear function resembling an inverted triangle wave. It takes only a few assembly instructions, yet is surprisingly effective.<br><br>

To not spoil "significant" themes like the title screen theme yet, here's a preview of the new "inside buildings" theme. In the original Metal Warrior it was just a repeating
melody, less than one minute total:<br><br>

<b>11th June 2018:</b><br><br>
This update goes more in-depth into the sprite handling and scrolling in MW ULTRA.<br><br>

Previous Covert Bitops games since Metal Warrior 4 have operated on the principle of each sprite frame having hotspot and "connect-spot" coordinates, and multi-sprite actors being
constructed by chaining these sprites one after one. The hotspot defines the sprite's origin, and the "connect-spot" tells where to place the origin of the next sprite.
For example humanoid actors' chain is: lower body, upper body, weapon.<br><br>

That particular chain works well, but designing multi-sprite boss enemies quickly gets tedious, as the sprites typically have to be joined from their corners to form
the complete shape. For example the 4-sprite large spherical droid that is the first boss in Steel Ranger. Furthermore, when pixeling the sprites individually it's harder to
get the shape right.<br><br>

Therefore MW ULTRA improves this system by introducing separate "logical sprites" in addition to physical (hardware) sprites.<br><br>

Each logical sprite has the hotspot and connect-spot, as before. But it can consist of multiple physical sprites as necessary. To use the Steel Ranger boss as an example,
since it has no separately moving parts, it could be one logical sprite with four physical sprites.<br><br>

The handling of human actors doesn't change much; since the lower and upper body can animate individually, they still need to be separate logical sprites.<br><br>

The logical sprites also include collision box information, so collision bounds can now be edited graphically instead of typing them into source code.
Physical sprites within a single logical sprite can have different colors, as well as X-expansion on or off. Each physical sprite is a separate "object" within its resource
file, and duplicate shapes can be detected, so for example a large car with front and rear wheels the same would save memory.<br><br>

The previous games used a few hardcoded routines for splitting actors into sprites. Typically these were an optimized routine for one sprite actors, a generic routine for
n sprites long sprite chain, and a separate piece of code for the humanoids.<br><br>

In MW ULTRA, each actor type has its own "draw" routine in addition to the tick update routine, and it will be called to output the actor's logical sprites. 
This allows greater freedom and extra logic during the draw if necessary. Furthermore for NPCs, enemies and bosses both the draw and update routines can be 
loadable code instead of residing in the main game engine, so the engine's resident code size can be reduced.<br><br>

The logical sprites are in turn split into physical sprites. In practice, optimization mandated that there's a separate fast path for logical sprites that have only one 
physical sprite and max. one collision box. In this case the logical sprite resource object also contains the actual sprite data, which saves resource file memory overhead. 
Furthermore, one resource file has a limit of max. 128 resource objects, so that allows placing more sprite frames into the same resource file.<br><br>

The screenshot below illustrates the new sprite editor in action, editing a large enemy:<br><br>

Then the second topic, the scrolling.<br><br>

Arriving at the somewhat unorthodox "whole screen redraw" scrolling in MW ULTRA required some prototyping and experimenting.<br><br>

Both the first and fourth Metal Warrior games (with Ian as the playable character) opted for color-per-tile graphics and 4x4 char tiles, making it impossible to get colorful
details to the graphics. At the time of writing Metal Warrior 4, it seemed absolutely impossible to get both color-per-char graphics and any sophisticated 
AI routines in. Hessian solved the problem by having 8-way scrolling with limited speed, dividing the screen and color RAM update on 3 frames total. Steel Ranger had
multidirectional scrolling, but a smaller scrolling window and much simpler enemy AI code. Plus neither player or enemies had separate weapon sprites, so the total load
on the actor and sprite system was kept lower.<br><br>

Reusing Hessian's 8-way scrolling was not really an option for MW ULTRA, as it will lag behind in fast falling motion, and generally introduce a jagged feeling
to the scrolling, which would fit badly with the varied scrolling speed (running vs. crouchwalking) and shifting the scrolling center depending on the player character's
facing direction (ie. show more of the world in forward direction.)<br><br>

Therefore the initial options appeared to be:<br>
- Traditional color-per-char, multidirectional scrolling, but with a limited-size scrolling window.<br>
- Color-per-tile, with 2x2 tiles. The saved CPU time would allow a max.size scrolling window (22 rows) while keeping one row for the status display.<br><br>

Before starting Steel Ranger's development, I had briefly experimented with redraw-based scrolling, using the tilemap data directly, but it seemed to have too much CPU overhead
and therefore not be promising. But in contrast to traditional scrolling, redrawing could allow to handle different tiles differently for optimization, e.g. some tiles could use a single color RAM value, or even a
single screen RAM value, or skip color RAM writes altogether.<br><br>

This time Ian would hopefully get the colorful background graphics he deserved, so the first option of the two looked more promising. It would also cut down on scrolling
code size, since only three different color RAM copy loops (up, down, horizontal) would be required. In contrast, an optimized 2x2 color-per-tile scrolling would practically need 
separate color shift routines for each of the 8 directions.<br><br>

However, early tests proved that scrolling that way could consume CPU time so much that slowing down could result in situations where the screen scrolls fast,
so that practically every frame is a scrolling frame, the player fires a full-auto weapon, and there are also enemy actors on the screen. And this was without any AI or enemy firing so far!<br><br>

Therefore I returned to examining redraw-based scrolling methods, and found a way to optimize the overhead of the tilemap access to acceptable. The key is indexing both
the screen and the tilemap data with the same CPU index register, leaving the other index register for the current tile's number for tile data access. With 2x2 blocks, the
screen indices would skip every second value, ie. 0, 2, 4... so also tilemap data would need to have the same tile row's tiles spaced to every second byte.<br><br>

This proved not to be a severe problem, as two tilemap rows can be interleaved. Therefore, no wasted memory space.<br><br>

Each of the visible tile map rows is handled in its own piece of code, so before the redraw, tile map addresses for each row need to be calculated. The redraw
code is modified directly for that, so that absolute address access can be used.<br><br>

The redraw writes to both the screen RAM and the color RAM at the same time, from the top to the bottom, so a doublebuffered screen is not required, but the redraw takes almost
a whole frame (on NTSC it gets very tight!) At first this seems counterintuitive, but the redraw happens in an IRQ that starts from the middle of the screen, and meanwhile the main
program is already calculating the next frame ahead as much as it can, without any busy-waiting. Given this, it appears that it's better to have a large amount of CPU time taken away,
followed by a frame that's completely free for game logic processing, instead of taking half of every frame for alternatively shifting either the screen or the color RAM,
as Steel Ranger does.<br><br>

The final thing to decide was: which kind of tiles would be possible? Initially, the redraw supported only two: either color-per-char (charcode & colorcode the same), or a
"default color" tile which skips the color RAM write completely. The default color would only be initialized when entering an area, not during scrolling. And
other colors could not be allowed to "leak" onto the default color areas. This scheme required only one branch per tile, but proved too limiting in practice.<br><br>

Therefore it was necessary to add also actual color-per-tile tiles. This slows down the redraw slightly, as one more branch per tile is possible. However otherwise it would
likely be impossible to produce the background graphics the game needs.<br><br>

Doing scrolling by redraw also gives the possibility to easily make arbitrarily large background animations (e.g. opening doors), as the CPU cost is just the same for scrolling,
and there doesn't need to be separate redraw code for the animations, like in the previous Covert Bitops games.<br><br>

After the redraw code was in place, the world editor (based on Steel Ranger's world editor) needed to be modified to support the tile types, and the char allocation scheme that
matches the charcode to the char's color. The editor needs to analyze the map data and check for which tiles the color RAM writes can be optimized away. When necessary, two copies are
produced from a single tile: one with optimization, the one without. Color-per-tile tiles are actually slowest to draw due to needing to access the tile color separately,
so they are avoided if the right charcodes for color-per-char operation (max. 16 chars with the same color) can still be allocated.<br><br>

The editor can also show a debug visualization, to see how the tiles will be drawn, which is shown in the screenshot below: (C is "color-per-char" and O is "optimize" which skips color RAM writes)<br><br>

<b>6th June 2018:</b><br><br>
MW ULTRA is the new Covert Bitops C64 game in development!<br><br>

It's essentially a reinterpretation or reboot of the first Metal Warrior game, but with substantial changes planned to both the story and gameplay.
The genre is still sidescrolling action-adventure, but the aim is to blend shooting, melee fighting and stealth in a
semi-realistic (or "semi-cinematic") way, with the melee fighting taken further by making the characters capable of multiple moves, including different punches and kicks.<br><br>

Plans for revisiting the first MW game were on the backburner for a long time, including the possibility to use a more powerful platform.
During Steel Ranger's development, ideas how to do it on the C64 materialized instead, along with a very solid rework & expansion of the original's
story. Like in the original, you take the role of Ian, a troubled musician in a not-so-bright near future, but apart from that, expect surprises...<br><br>

Technically, the game borrows the 2x2 tiles from Steel Ranger, but with a larger scrolling window that is redrawn completely from the tilemap data for each
scrolling update, instead of shifting the screen. Tiles can have their color RAM data updated differently to optimize the CPU use of scrolling,
either color-per-char with char & color code the same (completely inspired by Quod Init Exit II), color-per-tile, or skipping
color RAM update where there is a larger patch of the same color.<br><br>

The resource management & code loading / relocation from Steel Ranger likewise makes a comeback. But Steel Ranger contained a shortcoming where loadable or
"story script" code couldn't load further resources from the disk, in the fear that it would get relocated in memory due to old resources getting purged, and
the code execution returning to an illegal address afterward, crashing the game. This time the engine should be capable of handling stack return address relocation to fix this!<br><br>

The music routine is no longer NinjaTracker 2, but the <a href="https://github.com/cadaver/miniplayer" target="_top">"miniplayer"</a> which was released earlier in 2018 as open source.<br><br>

The engine work is going along well, with almost all the "whole time resident" code written, but naturally there is still much work to be done. The game is planned to
be finished in 2019, 20 years after the original's release!<br><br>

Here's the first WIP video, showing player character movement & initial city background graphics. Note: despite being absent in this video, there's certainly going to be all-directional scrolling, and ingame music.<br><br>
