Reinterpretation / reboot of the first Metal Warrior game, but now as a "semi-cinematic" action-adventure with shooting, fighting & stealth combined. Reprise the role of the
troubled musician Ian in a near-future world where the sun still doesn't shine much, but apart from that, expect surprises...<br><br>

A Turrican / Metroid inspired action-adventure game. Set in the same universe as Hessian but two hundred years later, you
equip yourself with a Ranger armor suit in a desperate war for survival against an army of machines, and set out to explore their
installation on a distant, barren planet.<br><br>

Take the role of Kim, a low-clearance security guard working a permanent night shift
(on her request) at the Throne Group Science Complex. One night, she wakes up inside 
a cargo container converted to an improvised emergency operating room. All she remembers 
are multiple unknown hostiles firing at the staff, heavy rounds hammering into her chest
and everything going black, then finally the shouted words filtering into her consciousness: 
"Massive trauma.. Need artificial circulation.. Prepare the nanobot injection now!"
<br><br>
Among other changes, V1.2 improves the controls (easier to fire while ducked), adjusts game balance for more
ammunition dropped by enemies, and removes splash damage to player from own explosive weapons.

As the Bastard Operator, you arrive late at work to find the building full of insane
paramilitary activists who don't care of human hostages but have taken all servers,
workstations & printers hostage instead and set up bombs at network equipment closets. Of course,
this can't be tolerated, so the logical course of action is to combat the activists
single-handedly.<br><br>
BOFH is a C64 conversion of the overhead view tactical shoot'em-up first written
on PC in the year 2000, featuring 360 degrees movement, many different weapons and
a 7-floor building (based on real location!) to explore.<br><br>

Technical note: the GBA side engine runs just 6502 CPU & SID emulation
